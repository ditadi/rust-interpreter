## Rust Interpreter

A small challenge for myself, write an Interpreter in Rust.

This project will be guided by: </br>

- Writing An Interpreter in Go Book (https://interpreterbook.com/)
- ThePrimeagen project of writing an interpreter in Go, Rust, and Typescript. (https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/ts-rust-zig-deez)

<i>The goal is to use 0 or almost 0 code from ThePrimeagen, only when I see some syntax blockers</i>
